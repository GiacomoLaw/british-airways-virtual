# VA website template
Just wanted to share a template that you can use for your va. It's HTML with CSS and Javascript. I used to use it for BOAC va, worked pretty well. Thanks to Peter Finlan for the base template.

I suggest using [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/928694.html) to host it for free. You'll need ftp access to that server.

Enjoy!

*If you find any problems, please make an issue!*
