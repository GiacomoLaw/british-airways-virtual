# VA website template
Just wanted to share a template that you can use for your va. It's HTML with CSS and Javascript. I used to use it for BOAC va, worked pretty well. You can find it here: https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/british-airways-virtual

Please note the license: https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-(agpl-3.0)

[Live demo](https://giacomolaw.github.io/va-website-template/)

I suggest using [000webhost](https://www.000webhost.com/928694.html) to host it for free. You'll need ftp access to that server.

Enjoy!
